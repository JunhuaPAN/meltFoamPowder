What kinds of things do we want for machine learning outputs? They are broken
down into 2 categories
1) Post-processing and historical data: record metrics at each point in the
domain, such as variables during solidification. These can be examined at the
conclusion of the run
2) Real-time data: This data should be highly time-sensitive, such as melt pool
shape or flow characteristics at each point in time. Data should be evaluated
and stored every N time steps.

Post processing and historical data:

Uniform temperature gradient - try not to have sharp gradients during cooling
within the system. You may want to output
- Gradient at start of solidification
- Gradient at end of solidification
- Gradient at middle of solidification (closest to alpha = 0.5)
- Average gradient experienced during solidification

Uniform cooling rate - try not to have sharp variations in temperature. You may
want to output
- Cooling rate at start of solidification
- Cooling rate at end of solidification
- Cooling rate at middle of solidification (closest to alpha = 0.5)
- Average cooling rate experienced during solidification

Real-time data
- Melt pool size: length, width, depth
--> derivable: aspect ratio
-  

======================================================================================
Merit function: 
- Should take a value between 0 and 1
- Should weight importance of various factors
- Should return poor value if small volume of part has highly negative
  characteristics
